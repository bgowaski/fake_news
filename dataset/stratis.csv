"A Python tutorial will be held next Monday, 9/16, between 3pm-5pm (during the TA office hours) at Richards Hall (RI 225). The tutorial will cover the same material we covered in class, but slower. You will have the opportunity to execute the code over the slides ""live"" with the help of the TA, but also ask any questions you may have about setting up python on your laptop, setting up an IDE like PyCharm, etc.",,,

"A survey has been made available under the Assignments tab on Blackboard (link). Please use this to provide feedback to the instructor about lectures, homework assignments, and the first quiz. The survey has only 3 questions and should not take more than 5' to complete. It is also completely anonymous, so feel free to speak your mind.",,,
"A student pointed out to me today that one does not need to cache ""scores"" on line 14 on the quiz. This is because the first ""scores"" RDD is used only on one lazy evaluation, not two. This is indeed true; I took out 3 marks for that, and I should not have.",,,
"Dear all,",,,

"To honor the original ""bonus"" status of the last question, completing the last ""bonus"" question amounts to 2 extra points. Following the same example, if you complete the bonus question that would add +2 to your final grade, raising it to 92/100.",,,
"If you complete the assignment without the final bonus question, you get a ""bonus"" of 10 points. As an example: suppose that your grade would be 85/100 after accounting for the 3 homeworks, the quizzes, and the final project. If you submit the assignment  and get graded 50/100 on it, you get a bonus of 5 points, raising your final numerical grade to 90/100.",,,
"You do not need to complete this assignment. The homework part of your grade (which is 40% according to the grading scheme) will be determined by the first three homeworks. This means that if you got 100% on all three homeworks, 100% on both quizzes, and 100% on the project, you will get 100% on the class.",,,
"HW4 is now an optional, bonus assignment, worth 10 bonus points (12 if you complete the final question) of your overall grade. What this means is:",,,
"The deadline for HW4 has been extended to Sunday, 12/08, at 11:59pm. This is the latest possible that gives the TA enough time to grade your work, if you choose to submit it.",,,
"On account of this, beyond extending the deadline, I am making HW4 an optional, bonus assignment. More specifically:",,,
"As I mention below, I have extended the deadline for HW4 to account for this disruption.",,,
"However, I anticipate that many of you may have been planning to make good progress on the assignment during the break. ",,,
I am also not happy with the fact that extending the deadline brings this considerably closer to the deadline for the final project.,,,
I also believe it is unreasonable of me to expect you to work on the assignment if the resources you need for it are not there. ,,,
"I would therefore like to cancel the assignment altogether, but this would unfairly penalize you for any progress you have made so far. ",,,
 I do not want any progress you have made so far to be wasted.,,,

 I am very sorry about this; I am in communication with IT to resolve these issues. ,,,
"They are affecting every Discovery user, not just the class. ",,,
"That said, I am quite concerned that the issue might be prolonged and not be resolved until after the Thanksgiving break.",,,
"Again, I will make every effort to reach out to IT throughout the next few days, but whether they take any remedial action on time is beyond my control. ",,,
Happy Thanksgiving-I hope you are having a wonderful break.,,,
The following announcement was just sent out by Research Computing. All problems with the cluster should be resolved.,,,

"Hello Discovery users,",,,
We sincerely apologize for the unexpected interruption in access to Discovery before the holiday break.,,,
The problem with logins and file permissions were caused by a mistake on our part.,,,
"We fully understand what led to the mistake, and we have been actively working over the holiday break to both fix the errors that resulted and improve our internal processes to ensure that it does not happen again.",,,

"If you experience trouble logging in or with file permissions, please open a Service Now ticket or email us at rchelp@northeastern.edu, and we will work as quickly as we can to fix your problem.",,,

"Beyond covering the theory behind statistical data analysis covered in class, the course also offers a hands-on approach, using Spark as a development platform for parallel learning. ",,,
"All homework assignments will be done in Spark, using the Discovery Cluster as a computing environment. You can find additional information on both in the Programming Resources section in Course Material. ",,,
"There will be 4 homework assignments, all of which will involve a programming component, as well as a midterm and a final course project. The grade breakdown is as follows:",,,

The math background we will cover in the lectures from Oct. 8th onwards will not be part of this quiz.,,,
"The second quiz will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 19th, in class.  It will includes all the material we have covered from Oct. 8th up to and including Tuesday, Nov. 12th. ",,,

There will be no questions on the quiz on the math background. ,,,
"That said, you should know this material as it is necessary to answer questions in the rest of the quiz syllabus.",,,
"For example, there will be no question of the form ""What is a positive semidefinite matrix?"" or ""What is the Hessian of a function?"", but there could be a question like ""State the second order condition for convexity"".",,,
