# A Fake News Generator with Varying Sentiment
Class project for EECE5645 Parallel Processing at Northeastern University, Boston,
MA.

This project attempts to generate fake news with a given degree of sentiment using
various news headline and body datasets.

# Methodology
Takes in globs of media text files (news headlines etc), calculates their 
sentiment, uses a markov chain (and RNN) to generate fake news (positive or negative),
regenerates the sentiment of the fake news to see how it did!
